This repo contains the source code for AsciiBinder, a documentation system for complex software projects. To learn more about AsciiBinder:

* Have a gander at the http://www.asciibinder.org/latest/welcome/[AsciiBinder documentation]
* Or just take the https://rubygems.org/gems/ascii_binder[ascii_binder Ruby Gem] for a spin

The AsciiBinder system was initially developed for https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs[OpenShift documentation], but has been revised to work for documenting a wide variety of complex, multi-versioned software projects.
