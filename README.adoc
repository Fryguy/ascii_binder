This repo contains the documentation for

* http://origin.openshift.com/[OpenShift Origin]
* http://openshift.com/[OpenShift Online]
* http://www.redhat.com/products/cloud-computing/openshift-enterprise/[OpenShift Enterprise]

The documentation is sourced in http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] and transformed into HTML/CSS and other formats through http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor]-based automation.

== Branches

Documentation for different OpenShift distributions is handled on different branches.

* `master` - OpenShift Origin latest code
* `openshift-origin-release-N` - OpenShift Origin most recent stable release
* `openshift-online` - OpenShift Online most recent release
* `enterprise-N.N` - OpenShift Enterprise support releases

== Repo Organization

Each directory of the repo represents a different collection of topics (you can think of directories as books). The exception is the `build_system` directory, which contains the code used to generate the finished documentation. Within each 'book' directory, topics exist as separate asciidoc files and an `images` directory contains any images that are included in the topics.

== Metadata

In order to construct the documentation site from these sources, the build system looks at certain metdata files. The actual format of these configuration files is TBD.

=== builder_top_cfg.yaml

The top-level configuration file tells the build system the order in which to display the "book-grouped" topics.

=== builder_book_cfg.yaml

A "book" level configuration file exists in each book directory. It tells the build system the order in which to display the topics with the "book" grouping.
